•	How is the school summary affected?
In the original analysis, Thomas High School started with a 90.95% overall passing rate, which was a concern to the school board as being too high. After calculating the total number of 10ths to 12th grade the student’s overall passing grade changed to 65.08%. That means removing 9th-grade students from the data set had a big impact to change the 90.95 % to 65.08 overall passing percentage rate.  ![per school summary orignal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107454933/180320020-0eeb9790-ce39-406d-9cb4-5561ef02f446.png)
